About
1inch provides a suite of powerful tools that enable developers to build smooth DeFi experiences on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and beyond. Hackers can utilize our open-source SDKs, smart contract protocols, and robust APIs to build onchain applications. In this hackathon, we are giving builders three distinct challenges:
* Build applications with extensive use of 1inch API
* Extend our Limit Order protocol with creative trading strategies for users
* Expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to one of the following EVM and non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos.

Objective: Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and Aptos.

Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet/L2 or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo (EVM testnets will require the deployment of Limit Order Protocol contracts)
Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
- UI
- Enable partial fills
